            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>Using your hands, work the coconut oil in until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, eggs, and milk and mix until just combined. The dough will be more moist and pliable than traditional biscuit dough.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper and pat into a ½-inch-thick rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds and pat or roll again until 1-inch thick. Freeze for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the freezer and use a 2½-inch round biscuit cutter to cut out 3 to 4 biscuits. Re-roll the scraps as necessary to cut out 8 1-inch thick biscuits. Place the biscuits on the baking sheet.</li>
                <li>If desired, brush the tops of the biscuits with a little almond milk and sprinkle with coarse sugar.</li>
                <li>Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.</li>
                <li>Assemble the strawberry shortcakes with the biscuits, strawberries, cream, and mint, if desired.</li>
            </ol>

          <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure your coconut oil is cold.</li>
              <p class = details>The cold, solid oil is key for creating layered biscuits that will puff up in the oven. I like to measure my coconut oil in advance and pop it in the fridge for an hour before I start cooking. I don’t recommend freezing coconut oil, as it quickly becomes too hard to work with.</p>
            <li>Cut the coconut oil into little pieces.</li>
              <p class = details>This is key! Once your coconut oil is cold, you want to keep it that way. Cutting it into small pieces means that you’ll be able to integrate it with the dry ingredients more quickly. That way, the heat from your hands won’t melt the oil as you work.</p>
            <li>Don't cut the chilling time short.</li>
              <p class = details>Colder dough yields puffier biscuits with better layering, so make sure to freeze the dough for a full 20 minutes before you cut out and bake the biscuits.</p>
            <li>Top dressed shortcakes with sugar.</li>
              <p class = details>Highly recommended to sprinkle right before you bake. Enjoy!</p>
            <li>Assemble the shortcakes right before you eat.</li>
              <p class = details>Leftover biscuits will keep in an airtight container at room temperture for two days. They also freeze well for up to a month!</p>
