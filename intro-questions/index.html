            <li> Eva Adams; Double Major in Economics and Psychology, Minor in Design; Senior </li>
            <li> As a design minor, I think it's important to have a well rounded variety of mediums for creation.</li>
            <li> I took CSE 131 using JS and am eager to learn different coding languages. I was especially interested in creating the snake game, and think it would be even more fulfilling to create using refined design elements.</li>
            <li> I hope to learn how to code from a design perspective.</li>
            <li> I imagine in designing for a screen it will be more difficult to create fluid and textural line work.</li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.glossier.com">Glossier</a> uses cohesive color and font choices alongside fresh product photos, creating an attractive brand identity.</li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> site utilizes font size and colors as well as thin grid-like lines to differentiate between topics, links, headings, and tabs.</li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.revolve.com">Revolve</a>'s website works well because although there are a lot of products to choose from, the site guides buyers with ease to product types and subtypes as well as the option to view by categories such as color, product features, and price point.</li>
