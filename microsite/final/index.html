        <h2>Immortality</h2>
        <p class = "quote grid nonindent">
            Some cultures regarded snakes as immortal because they appeared to be reincarnated from themselves when they
            sloughed their skins. <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ae/6a/1d/ae6a1d6354a7811d3463fcf3851eec84.jpg" class = "sloughed">
        </p>
        
        <p><span class="quote">Snakes</span> were often also associated with <span class ="lighter">immortality</span> because they were observed biting
            their tails to form a circle and when they coiled they formed spirals. Both circles and spirals were seen as
            symbols of <span class ="lighter">eternity</span>. The circle was particularly important to Dahomeyan myth where the snake-god Danh
            circled the world like a belt, corseting it and preventing it from flying apart in splinters. In Egyptian
            myth, the state of existence before creation was symbolised as Amduat, a many-coiled serpent from which Ra
            the Sun and all of creation arose, returning each night and being reborn every morning. 
            
        <p class = "img"><img src="https://cutewallpaper.org/21/ouroboros-wallpaper/Ouroboros-Wallpaper-54-Pictures.jpg" class ="ouroboros"></p>
        
        <p class="nonindent"> Also, the snake biting its tail (Ouroboros) symbolised the sea as the eternal ring which enclosed the world. In Egypt the
            snake has healing abilities. Hymns and offerings were made to it since it was believed that the Goddess
            could manifest through the snake. 
        </p>
        <p><span class="quote">"In a hymn to the goddess Mertseger, a workman on the Necropolis of Thebes
            relates how the goddess came to him in the form of a snake to heal his illness."</span>
        </span></p>
        <p>
            <span class="quote">In Serer cosmogony and religion, </span>the serpent is the <span class = "lighter">symbol of the pangool,</span> the saints and ancestral spirits
            of the Serer people of West Africa. When a person dies, the Serer believe that their soul must make its way
            to Jaaniiw (a place where goods souls go). Before the soul can reach Jaaniiw in order to reincarnate (ciiɗ
            in Serer), it must transform into a black snake. During this transformation, the snake hides in a tree.
            For this reason, <span class ="lighter">it is taboo in Serer culture to kill snakes.</span> A great degree of respect is afforded to
            snakes in Serer culture, as they are the very embodiment and symbol of their saints and ancestral
            spirits. </p>
        <p> <span class="quote">Like their Serer counterparts, </span>the Dogon people of Mali also have great reverence for
            the serpent. The serpent plays an active role in Dogon religion and cosmogony. The mythology of the Dogon's
            primordial ancestor Lebe, it based almost entirely on a serpent mythology. In their traditional African
            religious belief, they say that the Serpent Lebe guided the Dogon people from Mandé to the Bandiagara
            Escarpment (their current home) when they decided to migrate to flee Islamization and persecution.
            The Dogon believe that Lebe is the very reincarnation of the Dogon's first ancestor—<span class ="lighter">who was resurrected in
            the form of a snake.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="quote">In the Sumerian culture </span>snakes were also very important as a <span class ="lighter">healing symbol.</span> In Hammurabi’s Law Code (c.
            1700 BC) the god Ninazu is identified as the patron of healing, and his son, Ningishzida, is depicted with a
            serpent and staff symbol.

        <h2>Creation Myths</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="quote">Snakes </span>were a common feature of many creation myths, for example many people in California and Australia had
            myths about the <span class ="lighter">Rainbow Snake, </span>which was either Mother Earth herself giving birth to all animals or a
            water-god whose writhings created rivers, creeks and oceans. In ancient Indian myth, the drought-serpent Ahi
            or Vritra swallowed the primordial ocean and did not release all created beings until Indra split the
            serpent's stomach with a thunderbolt. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="quote">In another myth, </span>the protector Vishnu slept on the coils of the
            world-serpent Shesha (or "Ananta the endless";). Shesha in turn was supported on Kurma and when Kurma moved,
            Shesha stirred and yawned and the gaping of its jaws caused earthquakes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="quote">In Chinese mythology,</span> the woman-headed snake Nüwa made the first humans. She made humans one at a time with
            clay.
        </p>
        <p class="nonindent">
            Delighted, she made another figure, and another and another, and each came to life in the same way. Day in
            and day out Nǚwā amused herself making mud figures and watching them come to life.

        <p class="nonindent">
            To conserve her energy, she dipped a rope in clay and flicked it so blobs of clay landed everywhere; each

            low-class.

            The classical symbol of the Ouroboros depicts a snake in the act of eating its own tail. This symbol represents the cyclical nature of life and death, life feeding
            on itself in the act of creation.

        <h2>Underworld</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="quote">Snakes </span>were regularly regarded as guardians of the Underworld or messengers between the Upper and Lower
            worlds because they lived in cracks and holes in the ground. The Gorgons of Greek myth were snake-women (a
            common hybrid) whose gaze would turn flesh into stone, the most famous of them being Medusa. Nagas, <span class ="lighter">"the
            demon cobra" </span>and naginis were human-headed snakes whose kings and queens who lived in jewel-encrusted
            underground or underwater paradises and who were perpetually at war with Garuda the Sun-bird.

            <span class="quote">In Egyptian myth, </span>every morning the serpent Aapep <span class ="lighter">(symbolising chaos)</span> attacked the Sunship <span class ="lighter">(symbolising order)</span>. Aapep
            would try to engulf the ship and the sky was drenched red at dawn and dusk with its blood as the Sun
            defeated it.

        <p>
            <span class="quote">In Nordic myth, </span>evil was symbolised by the serpent (actually a dragon) Nidhogg <span class ="lighter">(the 'Dread Biter')</span> who
            coiled around one of the three roots of Yggdrasil the Tree of Life, and tried to choke or gnaw the life from

            <span class="quote">In ancient Slavic paganism </span>a deity by the name of Veles presided over the underworld. He is
            almost always portrayed as a serpent or dragon depending on the particular myth. The underworld was part of
            a mythical world tree. The roots of this tree (usually growing in water) were guarded by Veles (Volos) the
            serpent god.

        <p>
            <span class="quote">The idea of snake-people</span> living below the Earth was prominent in American myth. The Aztec underworld,
            Mictlan was protected by python-trees, a gigantic alligator and a snake, all of which spirits had to evade
            by physical ducking and weaving or cunning, before they could start the journey towards <span class ="lighter">immortality.</span> In
            North America, the Brule Sioux people told of three brothers transformed into rattlesnakes which permanently
            helped and guided their human relatives.

        <p>
            <span class="quote">The Pomo people </span>told of a woman who married a rattlesnake-prince and gave birth to four snake-children who
            freely moved between the two worlds of their parents. The Hopi people told of a young man who ventured into
            the underworld and married a snake-princess.

            <span class="quote">Snakes</span> were also commonly associated with water especially myths about the primordial ocean being formed of
            a huge coiled snake as in Ahi/Vritra in early Indian myth and Jormungand in Nordic myth. <span class ="lighter">Sea monsters</span>
            lived in every ocean from the seven-headed crocodile-serpent Leviathan of Hebrew myth to the sea-god
            Koloowisi of the Zuni people of North America and the Greek monster Scylla with twelve snake-necks. In some
            cultures, eels (which spend their early lives in freshwater before returning to the sea as adults) were

            <span class="quote">Rivers and lakes </span>often had <span class ="lighter">snake-gods</span> or <span class ="lighter">snake-guardians</span> including Untekhi the fearsome water-spirit of the
            Missouri River. Until recently, some northern European communities held well dressing ceremonies to appease
            the snake-spirits which lived in village wells and told legends of saints defeating malevolent lake-snakes
            e.g. Saint George killing a maiden-devouring serpent or Saint Columba lecturing the Loch Ness Monster which
            then stopped eating humans and became shy of human visitors.

            Carved stones depicting a seven-headed cobra are commonly found near the sluices of the ancient irrigation

        <h2>Wisdom</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="quote">Snakes</span> were associated with wisdom in many mythologies, perhaps due to the appearance of pondering their
            actions as they prepare to strike, which was copied by medicine men in the build-up to prophecy in parts of
            West Africa. Usually the wisdom of snakes was regarded as ancient and beneficial towards humans but
            sometimes it could be directed against humans. In East Asia snake-dragons watched over good harvests, rain,
            fertility and the cycle of the seasons, whilst in ancient Greece and India, snakes were considered to be
            lucky and snake-amulets were used as talismans against evil.

            <span class="quote">The Biblical story</span> of the fall of man tells of how Adam and Eve were deceived into disobeying God by a snake
            (identified as Satan by both Paul and John in II Corinthians and Revelation, respectively). In the story,
            the snake convinces Eve to eat fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which she then convinces
            Adam to do as well. As a result, God banishes Adam and Eve from the garden and curses the snake.

            <span class="quote">In the state of Kerala, India,</span> snake shrines occupy most households. Snakes were called upon by the creator
            of Kerala, Parasurama, to make the saline land fertile. The Mannarasala Shri Nagaraja Temple is one of the
            main centres of worship. The presiding deity here is Nagaraja - a five-headed snake god born to human
            parents as a blessing for their caretaking of snakes during a fire. It is believed that Nagaraja left his
            earthly life and took Samadhi but still resides in a chamber of the temple.
